        I have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, with a
        keen eye for creating responsive and visually appealing web designs. My
        journey in the world of web development are hosted on GitHub.One of my
        primary areas of focus is building web applications using React
        progressing to NextJS and integrating them with robust databases,
        particularly MongoDB or Postman Also PHP using MySQL which acts similar
        to MongoDB. This allows me to create dynamic, data-driven solutions that
        meet the unique needs of businesses and users alike.
